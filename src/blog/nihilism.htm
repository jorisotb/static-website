Optimistic Nihilism
[wip] <br>
There are a great many ideologies, philosophies and beliefs in this world. Central to many of them is a desire to provide meaning and, by extension, a reason behind our existence. And then there is nihilism. Nihilism is the antithesis of this notion: the idea that there is no rhyme or reason at all.
<br><br>
An excellent way to express this sentiment comes to us courtesy of Polish black metal band Mg≈Ça:
<blockquote>
    <q>The great truth is there isn't one</q>
</blockquote>
This sentence, with which they open their album "Exercises in Futility", presents an interesting idea. It goes further than saying there is no great truth; It implies the paradoxical notion that the lack of a great truth <em>is</em> the greatest truth. As is tradition in extreme metal, the rest of the lyrics are quite morose, but this excerpt specifically does not have to be read in a negative light.
<br><br>
Quite the contrary. Our insignificant position in the infinite universe, and the subsequent lack of any ultimate truth or meaning, I can only see as something positive. In the absence of a predefined goal, we are provided with a blank canvas. We are free to decide for ourselves what that canvas will show as our lives progress. Whether you use that freedom to devise grand aspirations, or by simply going with whatever life throws at you does not matter. If you ask me, not having a goal in mind does not imply that you are looking for one. One can be fully content wandering, whether metaphorically or physically, without knowing where you want to end up.
<br><br>
On top of providing freedom, a nihilist outlook relieves stress and worry. The knowledge that you have nowhere you <em>must</em> go, and nothing you <em>must</em> do, allows you to believe that things will turn out fine in the long run. The words <q>it'll be fine</q> got me through many stressful situations because I know that I will not need to worry about what could have been.

This sentiment is echoed beautifully in the following quote by J.R.R. Tolkien:
<blockquote>
    <q>'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.'</q>
</blockquote>
<br><br>
<br><br>
[See it as the difference between careless and carefree.], [<q>it will be fine</q>]
<br><br>
In short, nothing truly matters, and that is a good thing.
