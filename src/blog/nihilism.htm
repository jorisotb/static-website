Nihilism, but the essay does not go in the direction you expected it to go
There are a great many ideologies, philosophies and beliefs in this world. Central to many of them is a desire to provide meaning and, by extension, a reason behind our existance. And then there is nihilism. Nihilism is the antithesis of this notion: the idea that there is no rhyme or reason at all.
<br>
An excellent way to express this sentiment comes to us courtesy of Polish black metal band Mgła:
<blockquote>
<q>The great truth is there isn't one</q> <br>
- Mgła, Exercises in Futility I
</blockquote>
This sentence, with which they open their album "Exercises in Futility", presents an interesting idea. It does not just say that there is no great truth; It implies the paradoxical notion that the lack of a great truth IS the greatest truth. As is tradition in extreme metal, the rest of the lyrics are quite morose, but this excerpt specifically does not have to be read in a negative light.
<br><br>
Quite the contrary. Our insignificant position in the infinite universe, and the subsequent lack of any ultimate truth or meaning, is something positive. In the absence of a predefined goal, we are provided with a blank canvas. We are free to decide for ourselves what that canvas will show as our lives progress. Whether you use that freedom to devise grand aspirations, or by simply going with whatever life throws at you does not matter. After all,
<blockquote>
<q>Not all those who wander are lost.</q> <br>
</blockquote>
Tolkien's famous quote can be taken to mean that not having a goal in mind does not imply that you are looking for one. One can be fully content wandering, whether metaphorically or physically, without knowing where you want to end up.
<br><br>
On top of providing freedom, a nihilist outlook relieves stress and worry.
<br><br>
[See it as the difference between careless and carefree.]
<br><br>
["it will be fine"]
<br><br>
[<q>I wish it need not have happened in my time,</q> said Frodo. <q>So do I,</q> said Gandalf, <q>and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.</q>]
<br><br>
In short, nothing truly matters and that is a good thing.
