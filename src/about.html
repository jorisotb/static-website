        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        Hello! I am <del>an eldritch being</del> just someone who likes to write from time to time. So I thought, why not make a site to keep the things my brain produces.
        <br><br>
        If you want to know more about me you will need to delve into the deepest abyss; uncover the most ancient of tomes; and find the end of the universe...
        <br><br>
        Or you can just use these links to see some of my interests.
