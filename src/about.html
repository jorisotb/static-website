        <h3>About me</h3>
        <hr>
        Hello! I am <del>an eldritch being</del> just a guy who likes to write from time to time. So I thought, why not make a little site to keep a Log of the things my brain produces. I don't expect many people to visit this site, let alone read my stuff, but here it is anyway.
        <br><br>
        If you want to know more about me you need to delve into the deepest abyss; uncover the most ancient of tomes; and find the end of the universe...
        <br><br>
        Or you can just keep reading.
