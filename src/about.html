        <h2>About me</h2>
        <hr>
        Hello! I am <del>an eldritch being</del> just a guy who likes to write from time to time. So I thought, why not make a little site to keep a blog of the things my brain produces. I don't expect many people to visit this site, let alone read my stuff, but here it is anyway.
        <br><br>
        If you want to know more about me you will need to delve into the deepest abyss; uncover the most ancient of tomes; and find the end of the universe...
        <br><br>
        Or you can just keep reading.
        <br><br>
        Here are some cool websites you can use to stalk me. Install an <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">ad-blocker</a> before visiting them!
