                        <q>'All right,' said Susan. 'I'm not stupid. You're saying humans need... fantasies to make life bearable.' <br>

                    Sir Terry Pratchett is undoubtedly by number one author. His work displays the deepest understanding of human nature I have ever had the pleasure to witness. I will probably write an essay about him at some point. (GNU Terry Pratchett) [wip]

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.</q>

                    I shall preface this by saying that I am thoroughly fascinated by Lovecraft's work, but denounce him as a person. [wip]

For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some devine force is really trying to mess up your day.</q>
