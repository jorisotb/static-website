        <hr>
        This is a static website. No PHP or JavaScript here. This was achieved using a custom site generation script written in <a target="_blank" href="https://python.org">Python</a>.
        <br><br>
        I chose this route despite knowing PHP and JavaScript fairly well, because I believe a simple blog site like this should be lightweight and responsive first, and fancy second.
        <br><br>
        Check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jorisotb/static-website">GitHub repository</a> for the source code of both the website and the site generator.
        <br><br>
        The site is hosted by yours truly, using a Raspberry Pi 4B.
